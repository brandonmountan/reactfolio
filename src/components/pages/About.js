        My name is Brandon Mountan. I was born and raised in Great Falls,
        Montana. My dad worked for the railroad and my mom was a registered
        nurse and they are both happily retired. I have one sister who is an
        attending physician in Denver, CO. I went to college at Montana State
        University-Bozeman. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Cell Biology and
        Neuroscience. After college, I obtained EMT-Basic certification and
        moved to Salt Lake City, Utah where I began a career in health care in
        various Emergency Departments throughout the valley. I currently hold
        EMT-Paramedic certifcation and work the the Emergency Department at
        University of Utah Hospital. The burnout has caused me to pursue another
        career. After taking a six month full-stack web development bootcamp
        through the University of Utah, I have fell in love with a new career in
        developing websites. I currently live in Holladay, Utah with my wife,
        two dogs, and one newborn baby boy. Work and Family keep me very busy
        but in the rare occasion that I have time to myself, I enjoy golfing and
        playing video games.
        <br />
        That's all for now.

        Thanks for listening.
