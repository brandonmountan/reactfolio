        Thank you so much for taking the time to visit my website. I would like to invite you to look around at everything here. There is a more detailed bio including pictures in the About tab. You may also browse to the Portfolio section where you will find a list of projects I have completed both solo and with groups. I have my resume displayed and downloadable. Finally, you may contact me with any questions or inqueries and I will respond within 1 business day. Thank you again.
